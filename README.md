# Machine-Learning-Prediction-Model
This project aims to train a machine learning model capable of predicting an outcome in any specific field, based on the dataset provided. Additionally, it includes a Telegram chatbot that allows users to interact with the model by inputting the required data for prediction.
For practical purposes, I only upload the code along with its corresponding model and chatbot for the water quality dataset. However, I also include two additional datasets as examples. Itâ€™s enough to simply replace the dataset and the columns you want to work with.
